Enabling us to provide them with a flawless Datawrapper experience will be your job.</p>\n<h3>The kind of stuff you\u2019ll be doing:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Developing new visualization features</strong> for specific customer groups. For example, an analyst at a financial institution might need different charting features than a data journalist at a local newspaper. We work with both, so that will be part of what you're responsible for.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Building &amp; maintaining integrations</strong> with other software and tools. There are all kinds of other apps and tools that Datawrapper interacts with in the real world, like CMS\u2019s and databases. Part of your job will be ensuring that those integrations are easy to build and run smoothly.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Extending Datawrapper</strong> to make sure it works well with large customer teams. When one person uses Datawrapper on their own, creating and organizing charts is pretty straight-forward. When there are hundreds of people creating charts in a large team, not so much! Ensuring that even the largest of our customers' teams don\u2019t hit any walls when using Datawrapper will be part of this job.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Who we\u2019re looking for:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>We\u2019re looking for a full stack web developer to join our Berlin development team, <strong>preferrably full-time</strong>, but open to flexible work time arrangements.</li>\n<li>You will have a full, regular employment contract. Due to the nature of this job, it will <strong>not be possible to do this job entirely remote</strong>. <em>Please save yourself and us some time and only apply if you want to work with us in Berlin.</em>\n</li>\n<li>On the technical side, most of the work we\u2019re doing is front end development work in <strong>JavaScript/ES6, D3.js, Bootstrap and <a href=\"https://svelte.technology/\">Svelte</a></strong>. There\u2019s a PHP and MySQL backend as well, but that won\u2019t be too much of your concern.</li>\n<li>We\u2019re looking for somebody who has worked in web development before, but you don't need to have specific experience with our tooling or choice of frameworks. <strong>We\u2019re happy to show you how our stack works.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What the \"client-facing\" part entails:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>A significant part of the job will involve <strong>interacting with users and customers.</strong> be it by phone, video call or email. We encourage everybody in our company to do this, but in this role it will be particularly prevalent</li>\n<li>That means we're looking for someone with <strong>good communication, interpersonal and written skills</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Strong English skills</strong> will also be necessary, as our users and customers sit all over the world.</li>\n<li>Not a must-have, but a plus: German skills, interest in or experience with data visualization, experience working in a software company.</li>\n<li>If you have <strong>any prior work you can show us</strong>, open-source or not, please feel free to include it in your application. We'd love to take a look at it. Even if you don\u2019t, please don\u2019t feel discouraged to apply.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What we can offer:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A big desk in our office in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg</strong>, where seven of us work (<a href=\"https://blog.datawrapper.de/about-us/\">Ivan, Lisa, Anna, Gregor, Elana, Hans &amp; David</a>). We have a massive library of data vis books, a coffee machine, tea en masse &amp; interesting conversations about mapping, data vis and UX. Also, we honour lunch breaks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flexible working hours.</strong> We're looking for someone who wants to work for us <strong>at least four days a week</strong>. There's no 9-to-5 culture in our office, though. Some people come at 11 am, some leave at 4 pm, others like to work from home from time to time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A question-happy, communication-happy atmosphere.</strong> We're all learning, and we want you to learn with us. If someone has an idea or a problem, we just talk. No meetings for most of us, a bit of Slack, lots of fun.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We don't care about CVs, just skills and attitude. If you don't find yourself 100% in the description, write Lisa an email anyway. Talk a bit about yourself and how your skills &amp; experience could be a good fit for this job, and ask us aaaaall the questions you might have:</p>\n<p><strong>\u2192 <a href=\"mailto:lisa@datawrapper.de\">lisa@datawrapper.de</a></strong></p>\n<p>We're looking forward to hearing from you!</p>\n",

If you consider yourself a non-dogmatic engineer, have a thirst for learning, and an eye for process, you\u2019ll be in great company.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to leave our client teams functioning at a higher level than when we found them.  We do this by writing high quality code alongside our clients\u2019 development teams, as well as mentoring their developers, product teams and stakeholders in software development best practices.</p>\n<p>We believe that practices like Test Driven Development, Pairing and Refactoring are the foundation of a high functioning software team. And, we believe that not all Agile practices provide equal value to all teams at all times. So, we approach each engagement as the unique opportunity it is.</p>\n<p><strong>As a Strider, you\u2019ll find a learning opportunity that\u2019s unmatched. You will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be part of an engineering-driven culture, one that has a 4.9 star Glassdoor review and has won Crain\u2019s -Best Places to Work 2 years in a row.</li>\n<li>Write high quality code with some of the smartest engineers in town.</li>\n<li>Immerse yourself in a learning journey that\u2019s second to none. No where else will you find the variety that being a consultant brings, all a subway ride away.</li>\n<li>Mentor and be mentored. Learning weaves a thread through all that we do.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>A Day In The Life of a Stride Software Engineer</strong></p>\n<p>You\u2019ll co-locate and work onsite at your client (all are in NYC). We are proud to call the most outstanding tech teams in NYC our clients, ranging from funded startups to Fortune 500.</p>\n<p>You are empowered to define what work/life balance means to you. Every day for every Strider is different. Here\u2019s how one day might unfold:</p>\n<p>9am: One-on-one with my manager. We grab coffee at Stumptown and talk about my career goals. I\u2019m noodling on a complex React story and I get my manager\u2019s take. We walk away with action items for next week\u2019s one-on-one.</p>\n<p>10am: Daily Standup. I\u2019m at work at the client\u2019s office. They\u2019ve got a really cool setup with dual monitors and nice pairing stations. I\u2019m on a team of 4 Striders and 4 client developers. Our Product Manager kicks off the Standup. It lasts about 10 minutes and then we\u2019re off to code.</p>\n<p>10:10-12:00 Pair Programming. I\u2019m pairing with another Strider. We continue working on the React story from the day before. We have questions for the Product Manager that we ask via Slack.</p>\n<p>12:00-12:30 Travel to Stride</p>\n<p>12:30-1:30 Lunch-n-Learn. Today, Stride\u2019s got a Lunch-n-Learn on Terraform Cloud that I\u2019m psyched about. Stacey, one of our senior engineers, is leading the session. We hold Lunch-n-Learns every few weeks and I go to about half of them.</p>\n<p>1:30-1:45 Travel back to the client\u2019s office.</p>\n<p>1:45-2:45 Retrospective. Retrospectives on my team are amazing. Today we\u2019re retrospecting our last release. I\u2019ve never facilitated a retrospective before, but my goal is to facilitate one this June. We have a nice rhythm and walk away with action items and confidence in the path ahead.</p>\n<p>2:45-6 Pair Programming. I get in a few more hours of coding. This afternoon, my pair is Amy, a junior dev who works for the client. I love mentoring and am really excited to have this time to mentor Amy. I\u2019ve been coding about 3 years myself, so at first the idea of mentoring someone else gave me imposter syndrome, but the Stride approach is fluid and allows for flexibility and it\u2019s been a huge career learning experience for me.</p>\n<p>6pm: Leave for the Day. It\u2019s been a good day, I throw on my headphones as I head to the subway.</p>\n<p><strong>What you\u2019ll be doing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing high quality code, and bringing a \u2018teach a team to fish\u2019 mentality to your project.</li>\n<li>Embed with development teams in some of NYC\u2019s most exciting companies to help them up their game and get stuff done.</li>\n<li>Advocate for non-dogmatic Agile software development best practices like Test Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Collective Code Ownership, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Improvement.</li>\n<li>Be part of a cross functional team that includes Striders (likely 2-6 Strider engineers plus a product manager) and client employees (likely engineers and other tech roles).</li>\n<li>Work with a variety of tech stacks, and a see a variety of tech teams. We embed with teams who write code in modern tech stacks such as Ruby on Rails, React, Angular, Python, Scala, Java8, Elixir, Node and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>You\u2019re a fit for Stride if you have:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>3+ years of software development experience</li>\n<li>Experience in multiple programming languages</li>\n<li>Excitement to learn new languages and frameworks</li>\n<li>Experience with TDD, story estimation, test writing, and pair programming</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What you can expect from us:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continuous learning on things that you are passionate about</li>\n<li>Competitive Pay and Benefits (including Profit Sharing!)</li>\n<li>Empowerment to work at a self-defined Sustainable Pace</li>\n<li>No travel, all of our clients are located in NYC</li>\n<li>$2,000 and up to two weeks of your time for self-directed professional development</li>\n</ul>\n",

    "description": "<p><strong>Job Description</strong></p>\n<p>Analytics Fire builds custom software for the solar power industry. We\u2019re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p>\n<p>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We\u2019re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.\nFor reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</li>\n<li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</li>\n<li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li>\n<li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li>\n<li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li>\n<li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li>\n<li>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a remote position. We\u2019re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We\u2019re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</p>\n<p>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</p>\n<p><strong>About Analytics Fire</strong></p>\n<p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p>\n<p>\u201cOur goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. Our dream is to be able to spend our time working on interesting problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.\u201d</p>\n",

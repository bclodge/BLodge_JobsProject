Calls github and stack overflow api/rss feeds, saves them to a database.
Then it plots the results to a map, and some filtering / printing based on the results.

Missing: Test, and GUI. But filters are there, they just pop up as maps/prints.

To run: run Sprint Four.Py if tables do not already exists in the DB, otherwise 
it will take a long time to build then populate.

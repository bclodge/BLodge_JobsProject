    "description": "<p>Attention Senior Backend Developers:\n\u201cSkyrocket Your Career As A Developer In The Dream Work Environment \u2013 While Solving Interesting Problems And Working With A Clean Codebase\u201d</p>\n<p>You\u2019ve finally found it\u2026</p>\n<p>The perfect work environment to skyrocket your career as a developer.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a talented, experienced and ambitious backend developer, then this page could literally change your life!</p>\n<p>But only if you keep reading.</p>\n<p>iPhone Photography School is the world\u2019s no. 1 online photography resource. To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</p>\n<p>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.</p>\n<p>Right now, we\u2019re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</p>\n<p>To attract the most capable developers like you, we\u2019ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</p>\n<p>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</p>\n<p>1 - Solve Interesting Problems</p>\n<p>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</p>\n<p>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</p>\n<p>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we\u2019ve got automated testing for everything.</p>\n<p>The point is, you\u2019ll never be bored working here.</p>\n<p>2 - Work With A Clean Codebase</p>\n<p>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you\u2019re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are \u201cWho the **** wrote this?\u201d</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t work like that.</p>\n<p>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</p>\n<p>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</p>\n<p>3 - Endless Opportunities To Grow</p>\n<p>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you\u2019ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</p>\n<p>We get how important growth is for developers.</p>\n<p>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we\u2019ll pay for it.</p>\n<p>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We\u2019ll encourage you to do it.</p>\n<p>4 - Get Expert Guidance</p>\n<p>Our developers are ninjas. But we don\u2019t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</p>\n<p>If there\u2019s something outside of our team\u2019s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</p>\n<p>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</p>\n<p>Join our team, and you\u2019ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</p>\n<p>5 - Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</p>\n<p>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already\u2026 while you had no clue it was a priority?</p>\n<p>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature \u2013 only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</p>\n<p>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they\u2019ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</p>\n<p>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</p>\n<p>6 - Work From Anywhere In The World</p>\n<p>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world \u2013 including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!</p>\n<p>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you\u2019ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</p>\n<p>7 - Stability You Can Count On</p>\n<p>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</p>\n<p>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.</p>\n<p>You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.</p>\n<p>8 - Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</p>\n<p>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</p>\n<p>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.</p>\n<p>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s What We Expect From You\u2026</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You\u2019re excellent at PHP</li>\n<li>You\u2019ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</li>\n<li>You've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</li>\n<li>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</li>\n<li>You want to participate in scrum teamwork</li>\n<li>You have an excellent attention to detail</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

    "description": "<p>Routing Squad seeks Backend Engineer (f/m)</p>\n<p>Hi,\nwe are Sudip, Ali, Paul and Aram from the routing squad. Our job is to create and enable routing solutions for our products and customers. We are looking for a backend-focused engineer to join our great squad. The main programming languages we use are Java 8 and Javascript ES6, but we believe that continuous learning is essential in an ever-changing and fast-paced technological environment.</p>\n<p>FIRST A QUICK LOOK AT US\nOur vision is a planet without traffic jams. Our mission is to transform cities by providing the most convenient and sustainable mobility solutions. We create outstanding products with technical excellence, an agile mindset, an open feedback and failure culture and fun at work. moovel is part of a large global corporation (Daimler AG), but at the heart of it we still are a startup. We act as a partner for cities, transport networks and mobility service providers with the goal of making cities smarter and creating an operating system for urban mobility that provides access to appropriate mobility options in urban areas and paves the way for the future with autonomous vehicles. Currently, 280 employees work in small creative teams in Germany and the US at four locations - Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart and Portland.</p>\n<p>HOW THE ROLE WORKS\nWe gather in small engineering teams organized around specific topics. The individual teams enjoy a high degree of autonomy, trust and responsibility. Innovation is key and very much encouraged and embraced in our teams. We value pragmatism, simplicity and collaboration. We live an open feedback and failure culture, because we know that both are necessary to find proper solutions. With us you will use state of the art technology and work self-determined in small, autonomous and agile teams. moovel tries to maintain a culture where engineers are provided with the tools of their choice and a friendly environment in which they can thrive.</p>\n<p>SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL DO\nTeams at moovel choose the tools they regard as the best fit for their problems, at their discretion. Hence the technology stack is rather diverse. We employ a microservice backend architecture based on Docker and AWS. Cloud Services are leveraged wherever they help us to focus on our task. We practice Continuous Delivery and value DevOps culture (you build it, you run it).</p>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0You design, implement, scale and monitor our routing backend which provides vehicle, public transport and intermodal directions for our mobility apps and platform\n\u2022\u00a0You implement routing algorithms in Java\n\u2022\u00a0You design and provide APIs around our routing services\n\u2022\u00a0You are involved in building infrastructure and tooling for importing data into our routing engine\n\u2022\u00a0You perform analysis to enable data driven decisions\n\u2022\u00a0You collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design and ship new features</p>\n<p>ABOUT YOU\nYou should have experience in writing, maintaining &amp; debugging Java code and should be concerned about clean, high quality and maintainable code. Graph theory and routing algorithms are well known to you. Also, vehicle routing problems (VRP) are no strangers to you or at least something you always wanted to learn more about and master. You have experience with and are open to get deep into OSM and GTFS data formats. Some exposure to service based architectures would be useful. Since we are working in a rapidly evolving environment you should be open to pick up new languages, tools and frameworks. Furthermore, we are working with Amazon Web Services so it would be good if you are familiar with cloud computing.

    "description": "<p>Transit Squad seeks Backend Engineer (f/m)</p>\n<p>Hi,\nwe\u2019re the transit team at moovel. We build services, munch data and process real-time information in all things transit - and we\u2019re looking for a backend engineer in the Berlin office to\njoin us in our effort to provide great public transit APIs as one of the pillars for moovel\u2019s rapidly expanding mobility platform.</p>\n<p>FIRST A QUICK LOOK AT US\nOur vision is a planet without traffic jams. Our mission is to transform cities by providing the most convenient and sustainable mobility solutions. We create outstanding products with technical excellence, an agile mindset, an open feedback and failure culture and fun at work. moovel is part of a large global corporation (Daimler AG), but at the heart of it we still are a startup. We act as a partner for cities, transport networks and mobility service providers with the goal of making cities smarter and creating an operating system for urban mobility that provides access to appropriate mobility options in urban areas and paves the way for the future with autonomous vehicles. Currently, 250 employees work in small creative teams in Germany and the US at four locations - Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart and Portland.</p>\n<p>HOW THE ROLE WORKS\nWe gather in small engineering teams organized around specific topics. The individual teams enjoy a high degree of autonomy, trust and responsibility. Innovation is key and very much encouraged and embraced in our teams. We value pragmatism, simplicity and collaboration. We live an open feedback and failure culture, because we know that both are necessary to find proper solutions.</p>\n<p>With us you\u2019ll use state of the art technology and work self-determined in small, autonomous and agile teams. moovel tries to maintain a culture where engineers are provided with the tools\nof their choice and a friendly environment in which they can thrive.</p>\n<p>SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL DO\nTeams at moovel choose the tools they regard as best fit for their problems, at their discretion. Hence the technology stack is rather diverse. We employ a microservice backend architecture based on Docker and AWS. Cloud Services are leveraged wherever they help us to focus on our task. We practice Continuous Delivery and value DevOps culture (you build it, you run it). On the Frontend (IOS, Android and Web) we adopted and embraced Technologies like Swift, Kotlin, Rx or React.</p>\n<p>Breaking down concrete tasks for this position is not that easy, but that's what makes it so exciting. Here are some things we want to entrust you right away:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You write, monitor, scale and architect microservices that comprise our transit backend</li>\n<li>You build infrastructure and tooling for importing data into our data stores</li>\n<li>You develop services using Node.js &amp; Python</li>\n<li>You perform analysis to enable data driven decisions</li>\n<li>You write processing pipelines in Python</li>\n<li>Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design and ship new features</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ABOUT YOU\nYou should have experience in writing, maintaining &amp; debugging web services. You should be concerned about quality and maintainable code. Some exposure to functional programming, async concepts and micro services would be useful. While having working experience in the Node.js or Python web stack is a plus, it\u2019s not a show-stopper in case you\u2019re flexible and well versed in alternatives like Rails or Play. Since we are working in a rapidly evolving environment you should be open to pick up new languages, tools and frameworks. Furthermore, we are working with Amazon Web Services so it would be good if you are familiar with cloud technologies and methodologies like 12 Factor.</p>\n<p>You should be familiar with SQL. Additionally, it would be nice if you have experience with any of Elasticsearch, Lucene, Solr or similar search technologies. </p>\n<p>As it is our corporate language, you should have good written and verbal communication skills in English.</p>\n<p>BENEFITS</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose your own hardware</li>\n<li>Working with newest technologies &amp; microservices</li>\n<li>Company pension plan</li>\n<li>Free breakfast, coffee &amp; water</li>\n<li>Mobility allowance</li>\n<li>Be part of an interdisciplinary team of experts</li>\n<li>Working on products with a high impact on society</li>\n<li>International teams</li>\n<li>Child care allowance</li>\n<li>Flexible working hours</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sounds good?\nWe are more than happy to meet you soon!
